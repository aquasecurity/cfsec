`cfsec` is a static analysis security scanner for your `yaml` and `json` CloudFormation templates.

Designed to run locally and in your CI pipelines, developer-friendly output and fully documented checks mean detection and remediation can take place as quickly and efficiently as possible

`cfsec` takes a developer-first approach to scanning your CloudFormation templates; using static analysis and deep integration with the official HCL parser it ensures thatsecurity issues can be detected before your infrastructure changes take effect.
